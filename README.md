Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

# Tolkien's movie trailers

This site shows a list of movies in a grid, upon clicking on the poster image,
the trailer should open up and play the youtube video.

## Changes

- Some changes were made, the color of is now set to `#d8ad36` when hovering
over the poster.
- The title of the site has been changed, also the navbar text.

## Notes

An attempt was made to use an IMDB api, but the documentation of the api
indicated it could only be used with Python 3, therefore no api was used
to fetch the data.
